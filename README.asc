= Window's Azure Pack, Implementers Guide

Welcome to the "Window's Azure Pack, Implementers Guide" book.

You can find this book online at: http://WindowsAzurePack.info/book

This edition of "Window's Azure Pack, Implementers Guide" is open source under a Creative Commons license.

The content is created using the amazing Asciidoc format for the text of the book, and Graphviz for the charts. We've also using O'Reilly's https://atlas.oreilly.com[Atlas platform] for generating continuous builds of the book so all major formats are always available.

== How To Generate the Book

There are two ways to generate e-book content from this source code.

The easiest way is simply to let us do it. A robot is standing by to look for new work on the main branch and automatically build it for everyone.

You can find the current builds on http://WindowsAzurePack.info/book[].

The other way to generate e-book files is to do so manually with Asciidoctor. If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at wap2013.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at wap2013.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at wap2013.mobi
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF  output at wap2013.pdf
----

This uses the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` `asciidoctor-epub` and `asciidoctor-graphviz` projects.
