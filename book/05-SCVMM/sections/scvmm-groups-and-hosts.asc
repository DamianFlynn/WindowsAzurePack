==== Hosts Groups and Host Servers
With SCVMM now installed, and a successful login completed, itâ€™s time to implement some of the basic configurations which will help our experience while working with Virtual Machine Manager

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-SC-VMM1**

===== Host Groups
When it comes to managing Hyper-V hosts and virtual machines, one of the first concepts that you need to understand is that of host groups. As the name implies, a host group is really nothing more than just a logical collection of hosts. At first, host groups might seem unnecessary, but remember that Virtual Machine Manager is specifically designed to provide large scale management capabilities. A large organization might have hundreds, or even thousands of hosts. In those types of situations it is helpful to have some sort of organizational structure for all those hosts.

Host groups may also have their place, even in smaller organizations. Consider my situation for example. I am a freelance technology writer and I work out of my home. Even though I am a one man shop, I have at least three different categories of host servers. I have a small, production environment that consists of two Hyper-V hosts. I have a lab environment that contains four Hyper-V hosts, and I also have a VMware based lab environment with a few hosts. Incidentally, System Center Virtual Machine Manager can manage VMware environments, although there are some limitations to doing so.

====== Planning Host Groups
The layout of your host groups will depend on the business scenarios you might wish to address in relation to your hosts, for example this maybe associated to geographical displacement of servers, hardware generations, physical isolations, logical segregations, and so on.

The structure can be visualized as a Left to Right tree, with one parent called *All Hosts*, which can host a multi-layer deep set of host groups.

The illustration, depicts just two sample structures which can be quite commonly found in Virtual Machine Manager implementations

[graphviz, HostGroupSamples, svg]
----
digraph g {

  subgraph cluster1 {
    PR -> AH
    R2 -> DV -> AH
    TP -> DV
  }

  subgraph cluster1 {
    UB -> BL -> AA
    GE -> BL
    UR -> RA -> AA
  }

  PR [label="Production"]
  AH [label="All Hosts"]
  DV [label="Development"]
  R2 [label="Windows Server 2012R2"]
  TP [label="Windows Server 2016"]

  UB [label="UCS Blades"]
  BL [label="Blades"]
  GE [label="10Ge Blades"]
  UR [label="UCS Racks"]
  RA [label="Racks"]
  AA [label="All Hosts"]

}
----

Ultimately, your host group structure will be established to represent your environment requirements.

NOTE: With careful planning, should it become necessary, you can refactor your Host Groups structure in the future. This will have an impact on many elements within Virtual Machine Manager including for example, Clouds, Logical Networks, and Placement; all of which can be carefully adjusted if necessary

====== Creating Host Groups
The setting is available by navigating to **Fabric** on the *Wunderbar*, then in the *Navigation Tree* expand the node **Servers**, and select the node **All Hosts**. In the *Main Pane* we will see a list of any hosts which might have being added to Virtual Machine Manager.

To add a new Host Group, Right Click on the node **All Hosts** and from the Context menu chose the option **Create Host Group**. A new node will be created under the node **All Hosts**, named as **New Host Group**, and will be highlighted in edit mode, so that you can name the node suitably.

Repeat the process of creating new host groups, until you have completed building out the model you have designed for your environment.

====== Creating Host Groups using PowerShell
Implementing the configuration using PowerShell is also very simple. All we are truly required to provide is the name of the New Host Group, and the name of the Parent Host Group. This works well as long as you keep the Host Group names unique; which is generally considered a best practice.

```powershell
# Parent Host Group for "Production"
New-VMHostGroup -VMMServer pdc-sc-vmm1 -Name "Production" -Description "Grouping for Services allocated to Development and QA Workloads" -ParentHostGroup "All Hosts"

# Parent Host Group for "Development"
New-VMHostGroup -VMMServer pdc-sc-vmm1 -Name "Development" -Description "Grouping for Services allocated to Development and QA Workloads" -ParentHostGroup "All Hosts"

# Sub-Grouping of "Development" Hosts running Server 2012R2
New-VMHostGroup -VMMServer pdc-sc-vmm1 -Name "Server 2012R2" -Description "Grouping for Services allocated to Development and QA Workloads hosted on Released Server 2012R2 Hosts" -ParentHostGroup "Development"

# Sub-Grouping of "Development" Hosts running Server 2016
New-VMHostGroup -VMMServer pdc-sc-vmm1 -Name "Server 2016" -Description "Grouping for Services allocated to Development and QA Workloads hosted on Technical Preview Server 2016 Hosts" -ParentHostGroup "Development"
```

===== Adding Hosts
The setting is available by navigating to **Fabric** on the *Wunderbar*, then in the *Navigation Tree* expand the node **Servers**, and select the node **All Hosts**.

====== Hyper-V Hosts and Clusters
To add a new host for management in VMM, right click on the node **All Hosts** to present the context menu, or from the *Ribbon* on the *Home* tab, select the option **Add Resources**. From either menu select the option **Add Hyper-V Hosts and Clusters** .

.SCVMM Console - Add Hyper-V Hosts and Clusters
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0063.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* The **Add Resource Wizard** will be presented, offering the **Resource Location** page initially, which is designed to query us on where the host we are about to add to the management scope is currently located. There are 4 choices to choose from, which include:
** Windows Server computers in a trusted Active Directory domain
** Windows Server computers in an untrusted Active Directory domain
** Windows Servers in a perimeter network
** Physical computers to be provisioned as virtual machine hosts

The steps which follow in the wizard will vary depending on the scenario which your hosts fit in, therefore We should follow the wizard steps specific to each scenario.

===== Windows Server computers in a trusted Active Directory domain

* On the **Resource Location** page, of the **Add Resource Wizard** we will select the option **Windows Server computers in a trusted Active Directory domain**, then click **Next**
* On the **Credentials** page, we will choose the option **Use an existing Run As account**, and click the button **Browse**

** In the dialog **Select a Run As Account**, choose the appropriate profile, in my example this is going to be **DigiNerve Compute Fabric Management**, then click **OK**

.SCVMM Console - Run As Account for Host management
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0066.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* On the **Discovery Scope** page, select the option **Specify Windows Server computers by names** and in the text box, **Computer Names** enter the name of each host you wish to manage, each on a new line, then click **Next**

.SCVMM Console - Identity the Host to Add to VMM
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0068.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* The wizard will then attempt to locate the named servers, and after a few moments, assuming the wizard has access to the servers, using the credentials in the previously provided *Run As* profile, we should see the system presented on the **Target Resources** page, in the **Discovered Computers** list, with the current Operating System details, and whether the host has already a Hyper-Visor installed.
** **Enable** the Check box to the Left of the server name, which we wish to proceed adding as a managed resource to VMM, then click on **Next**

.SCVMM Console - Select the Validated Hosts to Add
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0069.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* On the **Host Settings** page, we will select the *Host Group* which we would like to add this computer to.
** Simply select the appropriate **Host Group** from the drop down list, which represents the groups we created earlier.

.SCVMM Console - Destination Host Group for the Hosts
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0070.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

** If the Host was previously managed by a different VMM server, and has not being rebuild, then you should also **Enable** the option **Reassociate this host with this VMM environment**, to ensure that the host has the correct trust between the agent and our current VMM environment
** In the **Virtual Machine Placement Paths** section of the dialog, we will define that the VMM server will place the deployed Virtual Machines to a Local Path on the host for now. To accomplish this in the **Add the following path** field, add the path **C:\Storage**, then click **Add**

.SCVMM Console - VM Location for the Host
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0071.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

NOTE: The path we defined for the local storage of Virtual Machines does not have to exist prior to defining it here, VMM will create the path on the first VM deployment if required

* Finally, on the **Summary** page we can confirm all the details we just provided, and once satisfied, we can start the deployment by clicking **Finish**
.SCVMM Console - Host Add Summary
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0072.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

As an alternative, we can also accomplish the same results using just PowerShell

```powershell
$RunAs = Get-SCRunAsAccount -Name "DigiNerve Compute Fabric Management"
$HostGroup = Get-SCVMHostGroup -Name "Server 2012R2"
Add-SCVMHost -ComputerName "pdc-vm-host01.diginerve.net" -VMHostGroup $hostGroup -Reassociate $true -VMPaths "c:\storage" -Credential $runAs
```
Once the Job has completed, we should see the new Host, and its relevant details presented in the Main Pane of the Fabric Servers view
