==== Initial Configuration
With SCVMM now installed, and a successful login completed, itâ€™s time to implement some of the basic configurations which will help our experience while working with Virtual Machine Manager

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-SC-VMM1**

===== Automatic Creation of Logical Networks
Before we begin any configuration on our newly deployed SCVMM service, the very first task we will undertake, is to disable a feature which will automatically establish Logical Networks for us, as we deploy agents to new hosts, based on its discovery. This setting simply generates a lot of logical networks to allow VMM to get VMs deployed quickly, however; in an environment where we will plan and design the network configuration, these Logical Networks will really just end up getting deleted.

Therefore we will save some work for ourselves, and disable this setting now, before we push and agent, or before we push MORE agents if we have not turned this off before the first agents got deployed.

The setting is available by navigating to **Settings** on the *Wunderbar*, then in the *Navigation Tree* select the node **General**, from the *Main Pane* we will see a list of settings, from here we will double click on the option **Network Setting**.

.SCVMM Console - Network Setting

This will open the Dialog for *Network Setting*, In the lower section of the Dialog under the heading *Automatic creation of logical networks* we will see, by default the option **Create logical networks automatically** is *Enabled*. We want this **Disabled** for our server

====== Disable Automatic Creation of Logical Networks with PowerShell
The same result can be achieved using the Virtual Machine Manager PowerShell Module, which hosts 400+ commands, including one to assist in the settings of the VMM server called *Set-SCVMMServer*

```powershell
Set-SCVMMServer -AutomaticLogicalNetworkCreationEnabled $false
```

===== Run As Account Profiles
In Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), the credentials that a user enters for any process can be provided by a *Run As* account. A *Run As* account is a container for a set of stored credentials, which can then be used for multiple purposes within VMM, including authenticating management access to hosts, to joining Virtual Machines to a Domain during deployment.

====== Defining a Run As account
The setting is available by navigating to **Settings** on the *Wunderbar*, then in the *Navigation Tree* select the node **Security**, and using the tiny icon to its left, expand the tree. Now select the node **Run As Accounts**. In the *Main Pane* we will see a list of pre-created Run As profiles.

.SCVMM Console - Default In-Box Run As Accounts

The initial *Run As* account we will define, is to be used for providing VMM Management credentials, to allow access to the hosts it needs to administer.

====== Run As account for Compute Fabric Management
From the Ribbon select the option **Create Run As Account**

* On the **Create Run As Account** page, we will establish the *Fabric Management* profile
** In the **Name** field, provide a name for the new *Run As* profile we are creating
** In the **Description** Field, provide a short concise description of the purpose of this profile
** In the **User name** field, provide the account name. This might be formatted as simply *Username*, or *Domain\Username*, or even *Username@Domain*; depending on the target use for this profile
** In the **Password**, and **Confirm Password** field, we can provide the password details for this account
** The **Validate domain credentials** checkbox will work on accounts which are associated to the same domain which VMM is deployed to only; offering a quick check to ensure the details provided are correct.
** For the *Fabric Management* profile, I will leverage the account *DigiNerve\!svcSC_MGTAction* which is a member of the *Local Administrator* group on the target server.

===== VMM Administrator Role
The setting is available by navigating to **Settings** on the *Wunderbar*, then in the *Navigation Tree* select the node **Security**, and using the tiny icon to its left, expand the tree. Now select the node **User Roles**. In the *Main Pane* we will see a list of pre-created User Roles profiles.

* Right Click on the *Administrator* role, and select the option *Properties* from the context menu.
** In the *Administrator Properties* dialog, select the page *Members*
+
.SCVMM Console - Administrator Properties
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0075.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

** On the *Members* page, we will see a list of accounts already delegated with administrative access to SCVMM, we will add to this list our Active Directory Group we created for managing our SCVMM Administrators. This group was called *DigiNerve\!admin SC VMM Administrators*
+
.SCVMM Console - Members of the Administrator Role

** Click on the button *Add*
*** In the *Enter the objects names to select* field of the *Select Users, Computers, or Groups* dialog, enter the name of the Security Group we created for this delegation - *!admins SC VMM Administrators*.
*** Now click *Check Name* to validate you have the account correct. Finally Click *OK*

** The Members list should now be updated to reflect the new group we just added.
** Click *OK* to commit the change

We can accomplish the same goal with PowerShell

```powershell
$userRole = Get-SCUserRole -Name "Administrator"
Set-SCUserRole -UserRole $userRole -AddMember @("DigiNerve\!admins SC VMM Administrators")
```
