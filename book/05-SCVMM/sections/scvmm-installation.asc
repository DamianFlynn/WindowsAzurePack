==== SCVMM Pre-Requisites
Prior to installing the main SCVMM Server, we must first deploy a number of Pre-Requisites to the server, otherwise the installation will stop, force us to install these components, and insist we reboot, before the installation can proceed.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-SC-VMM1**





===== Windows Application Deployment Kit for Windows 8.1
Navigate to the source of your installation media. For example I have hosted all my media on a file server called **LAB-FS-SMB1** with a share called **Installs**, thus I will be using a UNC path similar to the following **\\\\LAB-FS-SMB1\\\\Installer\\\\SystemCenter2012R2\VirtualMachineManager**


Launch the Installation Wizard, and select the option **Installation Path** presented on the initial the splash page

* Time for the all-important License agreement that we all read and study in detail of course... When you feel like you are ready to take the risk, Click the option **I have read, understood, and agreed with the terms of the license agreement**, then Click *Next*

* Select the Features of the kit we need to install. For VMM the modules we need to install are *Deployment Tools* and *Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE)*, then click *Install*

.ADK 8.1 - Features
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0011.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* The *Installing features...* page will then be presented, as the system deploys the features

* Completed

.ADK 8.1 - Completed
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0013.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

That's it, we now have the Application Deployment Tools installed, to ensure that VMM can work with Windows Images, and is ready for Bare Metal Image support.

===== Distributed Key
I want to put some theory here so you can at least make an idea what Distributed Key Management or DKM is and why do you need to know how to configure it. VMM encrypts some of the data in the VMM database like the administrator passwords, Run As account credentials and product key information. In order for the VMM server to be able to access that information, it’s using decryption keys that are stored on the local server.

Well…they were until server 2012, but now you can choose to store them in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). I know you are thinking that storing the decryption keys on the local VMM server is good or it was good enough for you. The problem arises when you need to move the VMM installation to another computer; the encrypted data will not be retained, because the encryption is tied to the specific computer on which VMM is installed. One other problem will pop-up when you try to cluster your VMM servers. If the decryption keys are stored locally and the node that encrypted the data (active node) fails, the other node(s) will not be able to decrypt the SQL information in the database since they don’t have the right decryption keys. This is why Microsoft made it possible to store the encryption keys in AD DS; a concept called Distributed Key Management or DKM.

DKM is configured during the installation of VMM, NOT after. When you get to the Configure service account and distributed key management page of the installation wizard you have the option to configure it by checking the box Store my keys in Active Directory and provide the path to the keys container. If the account you are logged in with has permissions to modify/edit the AD schema (not recommended) you can simply type the path to the keys container and hit Next.

To follow the installation best practice, log in with a domain user account that has administrative permissions only on the VMM server (svc_vmm in this example) and create the keys container manually in AD. For more information on rights requirements for VMM administrative tasks

* Open Active Directory Services Interfaces Editor (ADSI Edit) from the Administrative Tools menu, right-click the root object and choose Connect to. Leave the defaults here and click OK.

.ADSI Editor - Connection
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0021.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* Now we need to create a new container for the VMM encryption keys, so browse to the System container, right-click it and choose New > Object. This can be created on any level of the hierarchy, but I like to put this in the System container.

.ADSI Editor - New Container
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0023.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* In the Create Object window select container and click Next.

.ADSI Editor - Create Container Object
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0029.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* Give it a name and continue. You can name this whatever you like, just don’t put spaces and special characters in it. Click **Next**, and then Click **Finish**

.ADSI Editor - Name the Container
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0031.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* We need to set the proper permissions on this container in order for the VMM wizard to be able write in it. Right-click the container and choose **Properties**.

==== Install Virtual Machine Manager Server 2012 R2 Standalone


Navigate to the source of your installation media. For example I have hosted all my media on a file server called **LAB-FS-SMB1** with a share called **Installs**, thus I will be using a UNC path similar to the following **\\\\LAB-FS-SMB1\\\\Installer\\\\SystemCenter2012R2\VirtualMachineManager**


Launch the Installation Wizard, and select the option **Install** from the splash page

.SCVMM Installation - Launch Wizard
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0000.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* The wizard will Launch the VMM Main installer, and after a few moments we can *Select Features to install* which in this case, we will select both, the **VMM Management Server** and by default this will also provide us with the **VMM Console**

.SCVMM Installation - Main Installation Wizard
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0001.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* Next, we will be provided with the *Product registration information* page, where we need to supply some details, including an optional Product Key. If you choose not to provide the product key the software will install in evaluation mode, good for 180 days, and you can choose later to re-license the product using the SCVMM PowerShell commands. Once ready Click *Next* to move forward

* Assuming that all the pre-required software is present, we will be on the *Database configuration* page, and can point our VMM to the SQL Instance which will be used for the service. We will use the SCVMM Service account to make the connection with the database; this should work fine, due to us including the Service Account in the SQL Instance Administrators group for the selected Instance we are about to use.

==== Launching System Center Virtual Machine Manager
Once the installation of our new VMM server is completed, the Installation wizard will be default offer to automatically launch the console for us. Of course we can also chose to launch the console manually, and even from a remote system. In the event that the console is not being launched on the server, which is quite generally the case, you must provide the VMM Server name in the field **Server Name**, which will also be normally post fixed with the string **:8100** which signifies the TCP Port which the VMM Management Service is listening on.

Depending on your security configuration you may also need to use the option *Specify credentials* to authenticate to the service.

.SCVMM Console - Launch Authentication Splash
image::images/SCVMM2012R2-0045.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

After a couple of moments, assuming there are no issues, we should be presented with the Virtual Machine Manager Console. This might feel familiar to you if you have already used other System Center 2012 Products, or if you happen to use Microsoft Outlook for your mail client, as these all share a common look and feel.

===== Navigating the Virtual Machine Manager console
There are a few things to point out in the console, as the console can present a lot of different relative information, and selecting different options will essentially *pivot* to view pane to present different context information.
