== Active Directory Forests

This chapter will be about getting started with Active Directory forests.
We will begin by creating the production forest, then take a closer look at how we can organise some the important resource which are to be hosted in the environment, and finally configuring DNS services to resolve across forests if your chosen direction is to implement multiple forests.
At the end of this chapter you should understand and have deployed, or verified your current Active Directory forests are ready for hosting your Cloud.

=== Production Forest
Based on your implementation decision you will create at least a single domain for your production network, however if you have chosen to follow the guide based on our production scenario, you will also need to implement the additional domains and configure any cross environment Domain Name Resolution (DNS) steps.

Implementations focusing only on Proof Of Concept deployments will only be required to follow the information in the section titled **Production Forest**, and **Domain Resources** may skip the section titled **Windows Azure Pack Forests**.

=== Summary

You should have a basic understanding of the structure we recommend for our forests which will be hosting our cloud deployment, if your deploying a Proof of Concept, or Lab you should now have 2 fully working Active Directory forsts, including the ability to resolve resources in each respective forest.
It's now time to establish our Private Key Infrastructure.
