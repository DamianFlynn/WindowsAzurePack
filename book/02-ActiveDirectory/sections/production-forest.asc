==== Deploying a new 2012 R2 Forest, Domain Controller

In the scenario where we are going to start fresh, the work is a little less complicated, as we will essentially take the prepared server, and simply promote it as the first domain controller in our environment (forest). The options for configuring will be quite similar, and we can again leverage PowerShell to make the process as automated as we like, providing the answers to the most critical questions as part of the command.

===== Promote a new Domain Controller for the Forest

Once the server is configured, we can now proceed to deploy roles on server which are require to allow the machine act as a domain controller. To start the process, launch a new PowerShell session with Administrative privileges.

```powershell
Add-WindowsFeature –Name AD-Domain-Services
```
Once the role has been installed, we can then proceed to promote the server to Domain Controller status. This process requires that we provide some details related to the environment configuration we are joining. For example some of the parameters we will need to provide include

[format="csv", options="header"]

AD DNS Domain Name, DigiNerve.net
AD NetBIOS Name, DigiNerve
AD Restore Password, D1saster!
|===

```powershell
$safeModePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "D1saster" –AsPlainText -Force

Install-ADDSForest –CreateDNSDelegation:$false -DomainMode "Win2012R2" -ForestMode "Win2012R2" -DomainName "DigiNerve.net" -DomainNetbiosName "DigiNerve" -InstallDNS:$true -DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS" -LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS" -SYSVOLPath "C:\Windows\SYSVOL" -SafeModeAdministratorPassword $SafeModePassword -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false -Force:$true –verbose
```
