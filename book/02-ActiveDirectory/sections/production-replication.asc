==== Sites and Services Replication Configuration

As you are aware Active Directory is a fully distributed, multi-master environment, and as such we need to configure the environment so that the Domain Controllers which might be deployed in different physical locations can communicate with other. Essentially we are going to use this information to help AD understand the relationship between your physical office locations, such as the Data Centres and the Field Offices.

===== Create New AD Sites

In my lab I am going to being with 2 locations, my Primary Data Centre (PDC) and my Backup Data Centre (BDC). As we progress we will also add some additional field office locations to the environment, using this same procedure.

You can do the following work using the AD Sites and Services tool, or using PowerShell

```powershell
New-ADReplicationSite -Name "PDC" -Description "Primary Data Center"
New-ADReplicationSite -Name "BDC" -Description "Backup Data Center"
```
===== Define IP Scope for assigned to a Site

With the new sites defined, we will next need to create the IP subnet which are associated with the location. Of course this will vary greatly depending on your environment, as it's quite likely you will have multiple subnets, for example you're Production, DMZ, etc. Additionally you will need to add any new subnets which are created at a later point in time. If you do not, then if a client is placed on one of these non-defined subnets, they will not know which site to speak to as local when authenticating with AD, and therefore could end up sending the requests to the far side of the globe.

If you are not getting communications from your network team each time they add new subnets to sites, which will potentially be using your AD forest, you can check the netlogon.log file all your domain controllers to see if there are any messages there to indicate that a machine from an unknown subnet is trying to authenticate.

```powershell
New-ADReplicationSubnet -Name "172.21.10.0/24" -Description "PDC Production Subnet 110" -Site PDC -Location "Ballina, Ireland"
New-ADReplicationSubnet -Name "172.22.10.0/24" -Description "BDC Production Subnet 210" -Site BDC -Location "Crossmolina, Ireland"
```
===== Create a replication link between the sites

Now that we have the first two sites defined and their initial subnets in place, it is time to start building a replication link between the sites. How you build this mesh will depend on the connections you have between your physical locations. For example you might have all your field offices configured to have replication links to both the Primary and then also the Backup Data Centre, or if you have a very large environment, you might have a HQ in Asia which you will have all sites in Asia to replication with, and it in turn will replicate with the Data Centre.

The decisions will be based on many factors, including the available Bandwidth and the amount of time which you are willing to wait for replication to complete. As an example in my lab I am setting the replication frequency to be every 15 minutes, therefore in a hub and spoke setup (Datacentre to Field Office) any changes applied in the field office or datacentre would only take 15 minutes to reach each other at worst case, assuming no issues in your environment. Additionally, if a change was to be applied in Field Office D, it would need to replication first to the Data Centre, and then once there, would need to replicate out to Field Office Q, which is 2 hops, and thus could take 30 minutes to complete.

Adding hubs in different parts of the globe essentially adds more hops, which therefore increases the replication times, so plan based on your business needs.

As we start I have only the two Datacentres, so the link will look as follows:

```powershell
New-ADReplicationSiteLink -Name "PDC <--> BDC" -Description "AD Replication Link for PDC and BDC Sites" -SitesIncluded PDC,BDC -Cost 15 -ReplicationFrequencyInMinutes 15 -InterSiteTransportProtocol "IP"
```
When I am ready to add field offices, I normally where possible have them replicating back to the Datacentre to keep the hops as low as possible.

===== Move Domain Controllers to their respective Sites

As part of the initial deployment, our domain controllers were added to a site in AD, which is created by default, with the name "Default-First-Site-Name". Now that I have or real sites defined, we can use the Sites and Services UI to move the Domain Controller to the correct site, or much quicker, we can use PowerShell.

```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServer -Identity PDC-AD-DC1 -Site PDC
```
===== Clean Up the Defaults

Finally, now that we have the new sites in place, replication partners defined, and moved the domain controllers to the correct locations, we can now go back and clean up the original sites which were created in AD Sites and Services for us during the forest creation. PowerShell to the task again:

```powershell
Remove-ADReplicationSiteLink -Identity DEFAULTIPSITELINK -Confirm:$False
Remove-ADReplicationSite -Identity "Default-First-Site-Name" -Confirm:$False
```
