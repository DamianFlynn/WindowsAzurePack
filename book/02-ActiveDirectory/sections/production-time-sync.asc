==== Time Synchronisation

One of the steps which we will have addressed during the upgrade of an existing environment, is the migration of our FSMO roles to the new server, which is not a required step in a fresh install, as there are really no options for the FSMOs to be hosted anywhere else.

The role we are currently concerned with is that of the "Primary Domain Controller Emulator". The server which is hosting this role we will reconfigure so that it will use an external time source for its clock reference, and in turn this will then be communicated to all other domain controllers in the environment.

==== Domain Controllers as Virtual Machines

If the Domain Controller is hosted as a Virtual Machine, prior to executing this command set, first disable any time synchronisation services which the Hypervisor maybe pushing into our guest.

===== Setting the NTP Clock

To understand the current configuration of the time service on this machine you can use the following command

```cmd
W32tm /query /status

Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
Stratum: 1 (primary reference - syncd by radio clock)
Precision: -6 (15.625ms per tick)
Root Delay: 0.0000000s
Root Dispersion: 10.0000000s
ReferenceId: 0x4C4F434C (source name:  "LOCL")
Last Successful Sync Time: 23/04/2015 12:13:34
Source: Local CMOS Clock
Poll Interval: 6 (64s)
```
Once ready, you can then proceed to instruct the system to use the time source from NTP.ORG, Time.Microsoft.Com, or other NTP provider you trust.

```powershell
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:time.windows.com /syncfromflags:MANUAL /reliable:yes /update
restart-service w32time
w32tm /resync /rediscover
```
Check the results of the change

```cmd
W32tm /query /status

Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)
Stratum: 3 (secondary reference - syncd by (S)NTP)
Precision: -6 (15.625ms per tick)
Root Delay: 0.1093292s
Root Dispersion: 7.8356531s
ReferenceId: 0x1766172C (source IP:  23.102.23.44)
Last Successful Sync Time: 23/04/2015 15:25:09
Source: time.windows.com
Poll Interval: 6 (64s)
```
In the results, we should see that the Source has been updated, and the Stratum has become *synced by NTP*
