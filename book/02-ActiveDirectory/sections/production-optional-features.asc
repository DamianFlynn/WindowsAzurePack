==== Enabling Optional Features

There are many gems to Active Directory, and as we get acquainted with its workings, we will bring these to life, however one which I think is mandatory is the Recycle Bin which was introduced back in 2008. If you have done any work in AD you will understand my feeling here.

===== Active Directory Recycle Bin Feature

The following command will turn on the Recycle Bin functions in Active Directory. Doing this now, will ensure that as you move to production you will be ready to deal with the mistakes which are sure to occur. We will come back later and look at how to use this feature, but for now, let's get it switched on.

```powershell
Enable-ADOptionalFeature 'recycle bin feature' -Scope ForestOrConfigurationSet â€“Target 'DigiNerve.net' -Confirm:$False
```
