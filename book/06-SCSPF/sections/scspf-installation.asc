==== SC SPF Pre-Requisites
Prior to installing the main SCSPF Server, we must first deploy a number of Pre-Requisites to the server, otherwise the installation will stop, force us to install these components, and insist we reboot, before the installation can proceed.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-SC-SPF1**

===== Windows Features
SPF is implemented as a headless solution, working as a RESTFull bridge to System Center; with the main focus on System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

The REST API is implemented on the Windows ODATA Management API with IIS as the providing foundations. Therefore there are a number of pre-requisites which we need to have deployed to the hosting servers.

```powershell
Add-WindowsFeature Web-Default-Doc, Web-Http-Logging, Web-Basic-Auth, Web-Windows-Auth, Web-Asp-Net45, Web-Mgmt-Console, Web-Scripting-Tools, NET-WCF-HTTP-Activation45, ManagementOdata,
```

===== WCF Data Services 5.0 for OData V3
In addition to core windows OS features, we also need to add some additional IIS functionality. These modules are available to download directly from Microsoft, using the following location http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29306

Once the Installer is downloaded, you will have a file named **WfcDataServices.msi**

Launch the installation of this feature, which should result in the following splash screen being presented.

.WCF - Installation Splash
image::images/scspf-install-0001.PNG[WCF Installation]

* Select the check box *I agree to the license terms and conditions*, then click *Install*. The Installation will then begin and add the new libraries to the server.

.WCF - Installation Progress
image::images/scspf-install-0002.PNG[WCF Progress]

* After a few moments, the installation should be completed, and the wizard should update to reflect that the installation is now complete.

===== ASP.NET MVC 4
In a similar scenario to the Windows Communication Framework components we just added to the server, we must now also proceed to add the ASP Model View Controller version 4.0 to the host also. Again this is available as an independant download directly from Microsoft, using the following location http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30683

Once the Installer is downloaded, you will have a file named **ApsNetMVC4Setup.msi**

Launch the installation of this feature, which should result in the following splash screen being presented.

.MVC4 - Installation Splash
image::images/scspf-install-0004.PNG[WCF Installation]

* Select the check box *I agree to the license terms and conditions*, then click *Install*. The Installation will then begin and add the new libraries to the server.

===== Virtual Machine Manager Console
Navigate to the source of your installation media. For example I have hosted all my media on a file server called **LAB-FS-SMB1** with a share called **Installs**, thus I will be using a UNC path similar to the following **\\\\LAB-FS-SMB1\\\\Installer\\\\SystemCenter2012R2\VirtualMachineManager**

Launch the Installation Wizard, and select the option **Install** from the splash page

* Assuming that all the pre-required software is present, we will be on the *Database configuration* page, and can point our SPF to the SQL Instance which will be used for the service. In our environment we are using the SQL Service instance we called SCDB, and configured with static TCP Port 10435

* On the *Specify a Location for the SPF Files* page of the wizard
** In the upper portion of the dialog, we have the option to change the *Web Service* location we will install the web application files to, along with also modifying the TCP port which the site will listen on; the default is 8090.
** In the lower portion of the dialog, we will focus on the *Certificate Services*. As part of pre-requisites, we issued a certificate from our production PKI environment, which is trusted by all the servers in the production domain. This certificate should be in the **Personal** certificate store of the computer. Select the option *Use Existing Certificate* and then set the *Certificate Store* to *Personal*, fianlly in the *Certificate Name* drop down, locate the certificate we created which was called *spf.diginerve.net*

==== Launching System Center Virtual Machine Manager
Once the installation of our new VMM server is completed, the Installation wizard will be default offer to automatically launch the console for us. Of course we can also chose to launch the console manually, and even from a remote system. In the event that the console is not being launched on the server, which is quite generally the case, you must provide the VMM Server name in the field **Server Name**, which will also be normally post fixed with the string **:8100** which signifies the TCP Port which the VMM Management Service is listening on.

Depending on your security configuration you may also need to use the option *Specify credentials* to authenticate to the service.

After a couple of moments, assuming there are no issues, we should be presented with the Virtual Machine Manager Console. This might feel familiar to you if you have already used other System Center 2012 Products, or if you happen to use Microsoft Outlook for your mail client, as these all share a common look and feel.

===== Navigating the Virtual Machine Manager console
There are a few things to point out in the console, as the console can present a lot of different relative information, and selecting different options will essentially *pivot* to view pane to present different context information.
