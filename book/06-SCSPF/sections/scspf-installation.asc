==== SC SPF Pre-Requisites
Prior to installing the main SCSPF Server, we must first deploy a number of Pre-Requisites to the server, otherwise the installation will stop, force us to install these components, and insist we reboot, before the installation can proceed.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-SC-SPF1**

===== Windows Features
SPF is implemented as a headless solution, working as a RESTFull bridge to System Center; with the main focus on System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

The REST API is implemented on the Windows ODATA Management API with IIS as the providing foundations. Therefore there are a number of pre-requisites which we need to have deployed to the hosting servers.

```powershell
Add-WindowsFeature Web-Default-Doc, Web-Http-Logging, Web-Basic-Auth, Web-Windows-Auth, Web-Asp-Net45, Web-Mgmt-Console, Web-Scripting-Tools, NET-WCF-HTTP-Activation45, ManagementOdata,
```

===== WCF Data Services 5.0 for OData V3
In addition to core windows OS features, we also need to add some additional IIS functionality. These modules are available to download directly from Microsoft, using the following location http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29306

Once the Installer is downloaded, you will have a file named **WfcDataServices.msi**

Launch the installation of this feature, which should result in the following splash screen being presented.

.WCF - Installation Splash

* Select the check box *I agree to the license terms and conditions*, then click *Install*. The Installation will then begin and add the new libraries to the server.
+
.WCF - Installation Progress
image::images/scspf-install-0002.PNG[WCF Progress]

* After a few moments, the installation should be completed, and the wizard should update to reflect that the installation is now complete.

===== ASP.NET MVC 4
In a similar scenario to the Windows Communication Framework components we just added to the server, we must now also proceed to add the ASP Model View Controller version 4.0 to the host also. Again this is available as an independent download directly from Microsoft, using the following location http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30683

Once the Installer is downloaded, you will have a file named **ApsNetMVC4Setup.msi**

Launch the installation of this feature, which should result in the following splash screen being presented.

.MVC4 - Installation Splash
image::images/scspf-install-0004.PNG[WCF Installation]

* Select the check box *I agree to the license terms and conditions*, then click *Install*. The Installation will then begin and add the new libraries to the server.

===== Virtual Machine Manager Console
Navigate to the source of your installation media. For example I have hosted all my media on a file server called **LAB-FS-SMB1** with a share called **Installs**, thus I will be using a UNC path similar to the following **\\\\LAB-FS-SMB1\\\\Installer\\\\SystemCenter2012R2\VirtualMachineManager**

Launch the Installation Wizard, and select the option **Install** from the splash page

** In the lower portion of the dialog, we will focus on the *Certificate Services*. As part of pre-requisites, we issued a certificate from our production PKI environment, which is trusted by all the servers in the production domain. This certificate should be in the **Personal** certificate store of the computer. Select the option *Use Existing Certificate* and then set the *Certificate Store* to *Personal*, finally in the *Certificate Name* drop down, locate the certificate we created which was called *spf.diginerve.net*

==== Service Provider Foundation Installation Verification
===== IIS Application Pools
The Service account which we chosen to use for each of the Web Services, will be used as the identity on the associated Internet Information Services, Web Site Application Pool.

To verify that this is indeed the case launch the *Internet Information Services Manager*

* Expand the *Application Pools* to observe the four new application pools **(Admin, Provide, Usage & VMM)** are each configured to use the service account *DIGINERVE\!svcSC_SPFService* as their respective identities.
+
.SPF Post Installation - IIS App Pool Identity
image::images/scspf-postinstall-spf-0001.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

===== Local Groups
After the installation of the SPF service is completed, the Installation wizard will have taken the liberty to create four local groups on the host server. These groups will be defined as follows

[format="csv", options="header", separator="|"]
|===
Group Name | Group Description
SPF_Admin|Admin Web Service Users
SPF_Provider|Provider Web Services Users
SPF_Usage|Usage Web Service Users
SPF_VMM|VMM Web Service Users
|===

To ensure that the service works as expected, In our installation we decided to use the same service account for each Web Service, *DIGINERVE\!svcSC_SPFService* therefore we just need to add the same account to each of the groups as a member

```powershell
function Add-GroupMember {
  param (
    [string] $Hostname,
    [string] $group,
    [string] $member
  )

  $objUser = [ADSI]("WinNT://$member")
  $objGroup = [ADSI]("WinNT://$Hostname/$group")
  $objGroup.PSBase.Invoke("Add",$objUser.PSBase.Path)

}

$Host = "PDC-SC-SPF1.diginerve.net"
$SvcAcc = "DIGINERVE.net/!svcSC_SPFService"

Add-GroupMember -Hostname $Host -Group "SPF_Admin" -Member $SvcAcc
Add-GroupMember -Hostname $Host -Group "SPF_Provider" -Member $SvcAcc
Add-GroupMember -Hostname $Host -Group "SPF_Usage" -Member $SvcAcc
Add-GroupMember -Hostname $Host -Group "SPF_VMM" -Member $SvcAcc
```

===== SQL Role Security
The SQL Instance which we selected to use for the SPF installation will now contain a new database called *SCSPFDB*, and the service account will have being granted *Public* security role access to this database as its default. However, this privilege is not enough for the service account to function correctly. To address this we will also assign the *sysadmin* role to the service account for this database.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-DB-SQL1**

On the SQL Server, launch the **Microsoft SQL Management Studio**, and connect to the instance we are using to host the Service Provider Foundation database, for example *PDC-DB-SQL1\SCDB*

.SPF Post Installation - SQL Authentication
image::images/scspf-postinstall-spf-0002.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* Once the console has opened, in the *Object Explorer* expand the *Security* node, and then the *Logins* Node.
* The Object Explorer should now list the accounts registered to the SQL Instance. From this list locate the entry for our service account, which is *DigiNerve\!svcSC_SPFService*
* Right Click, on the node for the service account, and select the option *Properties* from the context menu
+

image::images/scspf-postinstall-spf-0003.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* The *Login Properties* dialog will be presented, Select the *Server Roles* page
* In the list of server roles, enable the role *sysadmin*
+

* Click *OK* to save the changes, and close the dialog
* Quit out of the *Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio*

===== Virtual Machine Manager Administrative Access
In order for SPF to expose full management access of the IaaS infrastructure, the service requires administrative access to Virtual Machine Manager so that it has sufficient privileges to manage the service.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-DB-SPF1**

To achieve this, we just need to ensure that the Service Provider Foundation service account, is listed as a member of the Virtual Machine Manager, Administrators role.

As part of the installation we deployed the SCVMM Console and its PowerShell modules on the SPF Server, we will launch this console and login with administrative privileges to the VMM environment. Doing so will also validate that we do not have any network or resolution related issues preventing the SPF node from connecting to the VMM Management Service node.

.SPF Post Installation - SCVMM Login
image::images/scspf-postinstall-spf-0005.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

* On the Login Splash screen, we will change the settings so we can correctly connect and login
** In the *Server Name* field, enter the name of the VMM Node, e.g. *PDC-SC-VMM1.diginerve.net* and postfix the TCP port of *:8100* to the end, as this is the port on the server which the VMM Management Service is listening to for new connections
** Next, select the option *Specify Credentials*, and in the *User name* and *Password* fields provide the details of the user account you added as a member of the Active Directory group we created and configured to manage the administrative access to Virtual Machine Manger. The Group was called *DigiNerve\!admins SC VMM Adminstrators*, and one of our members of that group was my administrative user account called *DigiNerve\Damian.Flynn.Admin*.
** Finally, lets click *Connect*
* After a few moments the console should open and provide us access to VMM.
* The Security Role settings are available by navigating to **Settings** on the *Wunderbar*, then in the *Navigation Tree* select the node **Security**, and using the tiny icon to its left, expand the tree
* Here we can select the node **User Roles**. In the *Main Pane* we will see a list of pre-created User Roles profiles.
* Right Click on the *Administrator* role, and select the option *Properties* from the context menu.
** In the *Administrator Properties* dialog, select the page *Members*
** On the *Members* page, we will see a list of accounts already delegated with administrative access to SCVMM, we will add to this list our Active Directory Group we created for managing our SCVMM Administrators. This group was called *DigiNerve\!admin SC VMM Administrators*
+
.SCVMM Console - Members of the Administrator Role
image::images/scspf-postinstall-spf-0006.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

** Click on the button *Add*
*** In the *Enter the objects names to select* field of the *Select Users, Computers, or Groups* dialog, enter the name of the Service Provider Foundation Service account *!svcSC_SPFService*.
*** Now click *Check Name* to validate you have the account correct. Finally Click *OK*
+
.SCVMM Console - Add the SPF Service as a Member of the VMM Administrator Role
image::images/scspf-postinstall-spf-0007.png[PKI Post Deployment Configuration]

** The Members list should now be updated to reflect the new account we just added.
** Click *OK* to commit the change

We can accomplish the same goal with PowerShell

```powershell
$userRole = Get-SCUserRole -Name "Administrator"
Set-SCUserRole -UserRole $userRole -AddMember @("DigiNerve\!svcSC_SPFService")
```
