=== Summary

That’s it, you now have an end to end procedure for requesting new certificates, or updating certificates which are due to expire. Keep these safe, and if you do need to share the certificates with others, I might advise you to request new “Copies” of the cert from your public issuer, as these copies can have different private keys; which will help isolate any impact in the event that should some of these nodes be compromised; that you have the ability to manage the fall out.
