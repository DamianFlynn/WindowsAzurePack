==== Requesting the certificate from DigiCert.com

===== Placing the Request
Now, we can navigate to your favourite Public SSL provider, and start the process of requesting a new certificate.
As indicated, my provider of choice is DigiCert, so the shots below will represent this, but you can of course swap out the steps as appropriate.
On the Order form
*	I will be selecting the SSL Product I wish to use, which in this case is a reusable *Wildcard certificate*.
**	In the *Names to Secure* section I will again indicate that my certificate will be for ** *.diginerve.net **

** As we have already created the Certificate Request using IIS Manager earlier, I now have to ability to provide this request at this stage also.
**	I can click the check box *Optional – I would like to provide my CSR and auto-fill names now*.
+
NOTE: Don’t be too fooled – this is not really optional! The options is do it now, or do it later, but be sure until this is done, you are not going to be issued a certificate!

**	Now I am presented with a new Pop-Up to provide the CSR
*** From the *Select Server Software* list, identify how we created this request originally, in this case we used *IIS7*
*** In the *Upload a CSR* field, we can simply paste the complete content of the request file we created in the previous step so that we can see it as illustrated below

===== Processing the Certificate

After the newly requested certificate has been approved and processed, we will proceed with the task of downloading the new certificate, to complete the issuing procedure.

On our account page, we should see all the certificates we have ordered. Selecting the new certificate which we just recently placed the order for, we should see a link to allow us to down load the new certificate to our server. This Certificate will need to be processed on the server we initially created the request on, so that we can combine both the public and private keys. Save the newly issued certificate to your server so we are ready for the next phase.
