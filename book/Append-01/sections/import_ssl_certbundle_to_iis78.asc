==== Import the CER and complete the Process
At this stage we should have the newly issued certificate bundle from our favourite PKI service, either public or private, it really does not matter. We will take the provided certificate file (.CER) and complete the request process, so that we are left we a real certificate ready for use.

The following steps will guide us on these remaining steps.

*	Re-launch the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager, and selecting the server name in the node list.
*	Double Click on the *Server Certificates* icon in the main pane to open the *Server Certificates* View
*	On the *Actions* list select the option *Complete Certificate Requestâ€¦* which will launch the *Complete Certificate Request* dialog.

*	Complete the process by clicking on *Ok*, the certificate should now be imported, to match the original CSR and assuming no issues we should be almost done.
*	The main pane in IIS should now be refreshed, and we can see the new certificate is presented to us.
