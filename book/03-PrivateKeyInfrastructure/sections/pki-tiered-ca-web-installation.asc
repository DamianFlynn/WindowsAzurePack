==== Provision the Certificate Enrolment Web Site

The Certificate Enrolment Web Site is an addon feature for the PKI CA environment, which exposes a simple Web Portal Interface, which users can use to request certificates from the PKI Issuing CA. The Service is hosted on an IIS instance, which will be deployed automatically as a dependency of the portal.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-AD-CA1**

===== Adding the Certificate Enrolment Web Site
Installation of the role feature is quick and simple with the following command.

```powershell
Add-WindowsFeature -Name ADCS-Web-Enrollment -IncludeManagementTools
Install-AdcsWebEnrollment -Force -verbose
```
===== Protect the Self Server Web Portal with SSL

Once the service is installed, we need to protect the site with a SSL Certificate

```powershell
# Request a Certificate from our Cloud Private PKI for protecting this site
$cert = Get-Certificate -Template webserver -DnsName "*.diginerve.net" -SubjectName "CN=*.diginerve.net" -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My

# Add HTTPS Bindings to the Default Web Site, which is where the Certificate Web Site gets hosted.
New-WebBinding -Name "Default Web Site" -HostHeader getcerts.diginerve.net -Port 443 -IPAddress "*" -Protocol HTTPS -Verbose

# Finally, lets bind the certificate we just issued, to the HTTPS Site
New-Item IIS:\SslBindings\0.0.0.0!443 -value $cert.Certificate
```

===== Register the get-certs.diginerve.net DNS Alias
With the site now established, we next need to add the DNS alias for this site to our internal (and most likely public) DNS Servers

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **PDC-AD-DC1**

* On the DNS Server for **DigiNerve.Net** which is hosted on **PDC-AD-DC1**
* Add a new **A** record for **get-certs** with the IP Address for the node *PDC-AD-CA1*, which in my environment is **172.21.10.22**

```powershell
Get-DnsServerZone diginerve.net | Add-DnsServerResourceRecordA -Name 'get-certs' -IPv4Address 172.21.10.22
```
Now, we can test everything is working correctly, we will launch our Internet Browser, and check that we can reach the new *get-certs.diginerve.net* site, and see that it responds
Launch your browser and navigate to *https://get-certs.diginerve.net/CertSrv*; we should be prompted for authentication credentials and once approved you should see the Certification Self Service page
