==== Preparation

We will start with some basic preparation work, in this case we will need some new servers which are going to be configured with thier respective role's.

===== Prepare Servers

For the deployment of the PKI Infrastructure for our Production environment we are going to implement a tiered PKI Solution, therefore we will need to prepare a number of servers, each of which will play an integral part in the delivery of the overall solution.

NOTE: If you wish, you may skip this section of the chapter and instead implement your PKI in a NON-Tiered approach; The guidance for which is covered in the section titled *Windows Azure Pack*. Play careful attention to substituting server, and domain names if you choose to take the alternative approach.

The server we will be configuring in this section is as follows

[format="csv", options="header", separator="|"]
|===
Server Name    |PDC-AD-CAROOT1  |PDC-AD-CA1     |PDC-AD-WEBAPPS1
IP Address     |172.21.10.x     |172.21.10.22   |172.21.80.11
IP Gateway     |172.21.10.1     |172.21.10.1    |172.21.80.1
Domain         |N/A             |DigiNerve      |DigiNerve
Name Servers   |172.21.10.21    |172.21.10.21   |172.21.10.21    
|===

Following the steps outlined in the Preparation section for the production Active Directory domain, proceed to configure all the respective servers in the above list.

===== Service Accounts
None Required

===== Delegation and Security Groups
None Required

===== DNS Aliases
The following records need to be provisioned on our DNS Servers.

In Production Environments, you would also publish the PKI alias on public DNS after exposing the service to the internet on your firewall

IMPORTANT: If you are substituting sections to customise your PKI deployment, pay special attention to the Domain Zone in the table below as you may need to change this.

[format="csv", options="header", separator="|"]
|===
Alias      |Zone               |Record Type| Target IP    | Scope               |Notes
pki        |diginerve.net| A         | 172.21.80.11 | Internal & External |DNS Alias for the Certificate Distribution Point web site used for CRL Publishing.
Get-Certs  |diginerve.net| A         | 172.21.10.22 | Internal            |DNS Alias for the Web Enrolment Self-Service Portal, hosted on the Web Portal Server
|===

===== Public Internet and Firewalls

Access to the following services should be made available trough your firewall. If you are also going to Translate the Network Address [NAT] for internet access, ensure that on your public DNS Services you use the NAT address you allocate, and not the internal address.

[format="csv", options="header", separator="|"]
|===
Service Alias          | Source Address | Target Address | Target Port
pki.diginerve.net| 0.0.0.0        | 172.21.80.11  | TCP 80
|===

===== SQL Database Instances
None Required
