==== Overview
There are a number of roles associated with our PKI Infrastructure, the following defines the distribution of the roles which we will be deploying as a two tier hierarchy utilizing a Root CA that is offline (normally disconnected from the network and/or powered off), and a subordinate issuing CA's that are online.

* Node A
** Standalone Root CA [Maybe turned offline and disconnected for the network for security, until required to issue new certificates]
* Node B
** Enterprise Issuing CA (There maybe multiple of these deployed for load distribution, or specific template issuing purposes)
** Web Server hosting the CRL and CDP services on HTTP (PKI.lionbridge.com) (HTTP CDP/AIA)

The level of security is increased because the Root CA and Issuing CA roles are separated. But more importantly the Root CA is offline, and so the private key of the Root CA is better protected from compromise. It also increases scalability and flexibility. This is due to the fact that there can be multiple Issuing CA’s that are subordinate to the Root CA. This allows us to have CA’s in different geographical location, as well as with different security levels. Manageability is slightly increased since the Root CA has to be brought online to sign CRL’s. Cost is increased marginally.
