==== Overview
There are a number of roles associated with our PKI Infrastructure, the following defines the distribution of the roles which we will be deploying as a single consolidated server utilizing an Issuing Enterprise Root CA that is online.

* Node A
** Enterprise Issuing Root CA (This environment can be scaled out with subordinate CA's at a later point)
** Web Server hosting the CRL and CDP services on HTTP (PKI.lionbridge.com) (HTTP CDP/AIA)

The level of security is lower than offered with an offline Root CA, as the private keys maybe a little easier to access in the case of a hack or internal leak.
