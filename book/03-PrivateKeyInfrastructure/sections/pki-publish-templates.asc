==== Publish Templates on the Certificate Authority

The Certificate Enrolment Web Site is an addon feature for the PKI CA environment, which exposes a simple Web Portal Interface, which users can use to request certificates from the PKI Issuing CA. The Service is hosted on an IIS instance, which will be deployed automatically as a dependency of the portal.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **WAP-AD-CA1** or **PDC-AD-CA1**

===== Publishing the Web Servers Template
The Web Server template is one of the most common, and is reguraly referred to as a Web Site SSL Certificate.
To issue these type certificates from our Authority, we will first update the main template to define who has privialges to use this certificate; then we will proceed to publish this certificate with its updated Access Control List to our Issuing Certificate authority.

====== Set the Security Permissions on the template
Running the following commands on the Issuing CA, willset the permissions on the Web Server temaplate, so that all Authenticated users can Enroll the certificate.

```powershell
# Add the Active Directory PowerShell modules
Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell

#Get the DN of our hosting Domain - eg DC=AzurePack,DC=local
$DN = (Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName

# Make a reference to the Template we are interested in
$WebTemplate = "CN=WebServer,CN=Certificate Templates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DN"

# Allow Access to the template
DSACLS $WebTemplate /G "Authenticated Users:CA;Enroll"
```

====== Deploy the Web Server Template ready for publishing
Next, we can again leverage PowerShell on the the Certificate Authority, to publish the template to the Certification authority ready for requests to issue.

```powershell
Add-CATemplate -Name "WebServer" -Force -Verbose
```
