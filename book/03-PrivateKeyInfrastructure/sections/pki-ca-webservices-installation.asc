==== Provision the Certificate Web Services

The Certificate Web Services is an addon feature for the PKI CA environment, which exposes an API Interface, which users and systems can use to request certificates from the PKI Issuing CA. The Service is hosted on an IIS instance, which will be deployed automatically as a dependency of the services.

IMPORTANT: Focus Server is **WAP-AD-CA1**

===== Add Certificate Web Services Endpoint

We can add the services which are required using PowerShell as follows

```powershell
# Add the Web Services Features
Add-WindowsFeature -Name ADCS-Enroll-Web-Pol,ADCS-Enroll-Web-Svc -IncludeManagementTools

# Start by installing the Enrollment Policy Service
Install-AdcsEnrollmentPolicyWebService -AuthenticationType UserName -SSLCertThumbprint $cert.Certificate.Thumbprint -Force

# Set the Web Site for Username and Password Authentication
Set-WebConfigurationProperty -pspath 'MACHINE/WEBROOT/APPHOST/Default Web Site/ADPolicyProvider_CEP_UsernamePassword'  -filter "appSettings/add[@key='FriendlyName']" -name "value" -value "DigiNerve Cloud PKI" -Force

# Next, Configure the Web Service
Install-AdcsEnrollmentWebService -AuthenticationType UserName -SSLCertThumbprint $cert.Certificate.Thumbprint -Force

```

On the Domain Controller
```powershell
# Get the Domain DN
$DN = (Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName

# The Name of the Certificate Authority
$CAName = "DigiNerve Cloud CA"

# The URI the Service will be published to
$webenrollURL = "get-certs.cloud.diginerve.net"

# The Confiugration Object we are going to update
$CAEnrollmentServiceDN = "CN=$CAName,CN=Enrollment Services,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DN"

# Fainlly, Update the object for Username/Password Authentication
Set-ADObject $CAEnrollmentServiceDN -Replace @{'msPKI-Enrollment-Servers'="1`n4`n0`nhttps://$webenrollURL/$CAName`_CES_UsernamePassword/service.svc/CES`n0"}
```

Test this worked
```powershell
$credentials = Get-Credential -Message 'Enter Valid Domain Credentials'

$webenrollURL = 'get-certs.cloud.diginerve.net'

#$templateName = 'DSCPullClientAuth'
$templateName = 'WebServer'

Get-Certificate -Url https://$webenrollURL/ADPolicyProvider_CEP_UsernamePassword/service.svc/CEP `
                -Template $templateName `
                -SubjectName 'CN=TestEnroll' `
                -Credential $credentials `
                -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My `
                -Verbose
```
