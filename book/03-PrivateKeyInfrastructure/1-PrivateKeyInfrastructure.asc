== Private Key Infrastructure

This chapter will be about introducing and implementing Our Private Key Infrastructure.

We will begin by implementation a PKI infrastructure for our production forest, then move on to establishing a PKI environment in the Windows Azure Pack forest if appropriate to your deployment option.
In this chapter, we will also cover the options to implement the PKI infrastructure in two different scenarios.

. Implement an Enterprise PKI with Offline Root CA.
. Consolidated installation with an Online Root CA

At the end of this chapter you should understand, have deployed and verified at least a single PKI infrastructure.

=== Production Forest
In this section, we are going to cover the deployment of the Production PKI Infrastructure, based on an Offline Root CA approach, however, if you are deploying based on a Proof of Concept, you can choose to skip this section and instead follow the steps in the section for the Windows Azure Pack forest. In that latter section we will repeat much of this same deployment, however consolidating the installation to use on Online Issuing Root CA.

Regardless of your chosen implementation path, you are recommended to deploy at least a single PKI infrastructure for the environment.

Production deployments are not mandated to implement a second isolated PKI infrastructure for there WAP Installation, however for security there are a number of benefits to taking this approach.

=== Summary

if you completed this chapter you will have deployed at least one complete PKI Infrastructure, including the supporting Certification revocation Web Site, your first Certificates, and a web portal for self service request of certificates.
It's now time to establish our SQL Servers.
